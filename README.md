#  Liver Disease Prediction (ILPD Dataset)

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict liver disease based on clinical features from the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD). It includes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and performance evaluation.

##  Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and encoding
- Classification using ML models like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

##  Files Included
- `ILPD (4).ipynb` â€“ Main project notebook with complete code and results

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/liver-disease-prediction.git
2. Install required dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
  jupyter notebook ILPD\ \(4\).ipynb
